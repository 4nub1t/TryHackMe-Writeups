# TryHackMe - Vulnerability Capstone

## Overview
In this CTF challenge from TryHackMe, we are tasked with auditing a vulnerable web application created by the fictitious company *Ackme Support Incorporated*.  
The goal is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in their new blog before it is released to the public.  

This exercise is part of the **Vulnerability Research module** and rated as *easy*.

## Question 1: Application Name
**Question:** What is the name of the application running on the vulnerable machine?  

**Process:**  
- Navigated to the target IP in a browser.  
- The landing page displayed a welcome message with the application name.  

**Answer:**  
`Fuel CMS`

---

## Question 2: Application Version
**Question:** What is the version number of this application?  

**Process:**  
- On the same page below the application name, the version number was revealed.  

**Answer:**  
`1.4`

---

## Question 3: CVE Identifier
**Question:** What is the number of the CVE that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on this application?  

**Process:**  
- Searched Exploit-DB for “Fuel CMS 1.4 RCE”.  
- Filtered results for Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities.  
- Identified the relevant CVE.  

**Answer:**  
`CVE-2018-16763`

---

## Question 4: Exploitation
**Question:** Use the resources & skills learnt throughout this module to find and use a relevant exploit to exploit this vulnerability.  

**Process:**  
- Attempted multiple RCE exploits found online, but encountered errors.  
- Discovered a working exploit in the AttackBox at:

```bash
/usr/share/exploits/vulnerabilitiescapstone/exploit.py
```

- The exploit is also available on GitHub.  
- Executed the exploit with:

```bash
python3 exploit.py <TARGET_IP>
```

⚠️ Important: Use the raw IP address without http://, otherwise errors occur.

- The exploit displayed a menu. Selected the option shell_me.

- Before executing, set up a netcat listener on the AttackBox:

```bash
nc -nvlp 4444
```

- Entered the AttackBox IP and chosen port (4444) into the exploit.

- Successfully obtained a remote shell connection on the victim machine.

---

## Question 5: Flag
**Question:** What is the value of the flag located on this vulnerable machine? (Path: /home/ubuntu)

**Process:**

- From the obtained shell, navigated to the directory:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu
ls
```

- Found the file flag.txt.

Read its contents:

```bash
cat flag.txt
```

**Answer:**
`THM{ACKME_BLOG_HACKED}`

**Notes**
- Exploitation required identifying the exact CVE and using a reliable exploit.
- The key step was establishing a reverse shell with proper listener setup.
- This challenge demonstrates how outdated web applications (Fuel CMS 1.4) can be easily compromised if not patched.
